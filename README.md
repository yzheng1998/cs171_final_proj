Title: Quaran-streaming
Team Members: Yuke Zheng (team leader), Cyrus Faruque, Stephanie Cheng

Project Abstarct:

We have created a tool that allows users to explore the differences in movie content between Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+, and ultimately provides a custom streaming platform recommendation for the user based on the user's movie prefrences. We are motivated by this project because our group has a strong interest in movies and TV shows, and we think that the insights produced from this data will be relevant and interesting to a general audience, especially in light of the pandemic and increased time spent at home.

Code Overview:

We have used only d3, jQuery, and bootstrap libraries. All other code has been written by the team members.
